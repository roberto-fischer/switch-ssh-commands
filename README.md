# switch-ssh-commands
This script is designed to send commands to cisco, a10, dell, and hp network devices. It utilizes the Paramiko library to communicate over ssh to them.

I wrote this because I wanted to be a control freak. Also to learn to code in python. Also because a large client wanted something to send command sequences to multiple devices.
